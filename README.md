# Stock Price Forecasting

## Project Description

Prophet is a powerful time series forecasting library for Python developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team. It is designed to handle time series datasets with multiple seasonalities, changing trends, and holiday effects. Prophet is built on top of a decomposable time series model with three main componentsâ€”trend, seasonality, and holidays.

In this project, we explore time series forecasting of the Twitter stock price data. We cover the following aspects:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We delve into the Twitter stock price data to understand its characteristics, patterns, and underlying dynamics.
- **Interactive Plots**: Utilizing Plotly, we create interactive visualizations to facilitate data analysis, allowing for deeper insights into the Twitter stock price dataset.
- **Prophet Model Implementation**: Leveraging Python and the Prophet library, we build a time series forecasting model tailored to predict the Twitter stock price. This model accounts for various factors such as trends, seasonality, and holidays, providing robust forecasts.
